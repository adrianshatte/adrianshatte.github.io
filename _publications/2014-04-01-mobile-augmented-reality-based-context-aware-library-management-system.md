Mobile augmented reality has gained popularity in recent years due to the technological advances of smartphones and other mobile devices. One particular area in which mobile augmented reality is being used is library management. However, current mobile augmented reality solutions in this domain are lacking in context-awareness. It has been suggested in the literature that agent programming may be suitable at overcoming this problem, but little research has been conducted using modern mobile augmented reality applications with agents. This paper aims to bridge this gap through the development of an agent-based, mobile augmented reality prototype, titled Libagent. Libagent was subjected to five experiments to determine its suitability, efficiency, and accuracy for library management. The results of these experiments indicate that agent-based mobile augmented reality is a promising tool for context-aware library management.
