This paper describes the progress of our ongoing research into collaborative report writing for emergency management using web technologies to improve communication and shared knowledge in emergency situations. Specifically, the work presented in this paper focuses on the development of a user attribution framework that enhances the Differential Synchronisation (diffsync) technique by exploiting its diff operation. This technique improves real-time collaborative editing for emergency management by combining the benefits of user attribution with diffsync features such as convergence, scalability, and robustness to poor network environments. As a proof of concept, we implement a prototype collaborative system and report results of simulations to test scalability, efficiency, and correctness. Further, we consider the potential benefits of this framework for web-based collaborative report writing in the context of emergency management.
