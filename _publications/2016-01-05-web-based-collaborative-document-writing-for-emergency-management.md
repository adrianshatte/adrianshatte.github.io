This paper describes the progress of our research into collaborative document writing for emergency management. Our focus is specifically on the use of web technologies to improve communication and shared knowledge in emergency situations. We present a prototype system built using Differential Synchronisation with flexible locking and user attribution features. Based on the past shortcomings of technologies and documents such as situation reports, we consider the potential benefits of a web-based system with flexible locking and user attribution for collaborative situation report writing.
