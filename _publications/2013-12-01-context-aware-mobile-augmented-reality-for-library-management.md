Mobile augmented reality applications aim to simplify everyday tasks by providing additional information to increase efficiency. There are many challenges facing the field, including efficient and accurate methods for providing context-awareness. It is believed that 
research in the field of multi-agent systems can assist such applications in reducing the complexity of everyday tasks. To determine the benefits of using software agents to support mobile augmented reality, we develop a prototype titled Libagent for library management tasks. Our experimental results indicate that Libagent provides benefits to users by reducing errors.
