***Roles: Lecturing, tutoring, marking.*** This course introduces students to written programming code constructs used in the creation of a software system. Students must have demonstrated previous pre-requisite knowledge regarding logical problem solving and basic algorithmic development. Using an agile and requirement based approach to development, students will be introduced to the use of design modelling tools and an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop and edit source code, then compile, debug, test and run a software application. Students will be exposed to principles involved in engineering, designing and developing applications for information systems using object oriented and event driven paradigms.
